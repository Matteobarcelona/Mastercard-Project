# Mastercard Job Simulation

Objective

Mastercard Cybersecurity virtual experience program on Forage - septiembre de 2024

 * Completed a job simulation where I served as an analyst on Mastercard’s
   Security Awareness Team 
 * Helped identify and report security threats such as phishing 
 * Analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust
   security training and implemented training courses and procedures for those
   teams

Task 1:
What threat phishing presents to an organization and what different types of phishing emails look like:
* Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone/something to get information, in most cases, this is usually a password.
* Attackers may send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or lure them into providing financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.
* Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. So it’s very important that we keep the business and our staff safe from harm.

How Mastercard prevents and mitigates phishing threats:
At Mastercard, one of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by educating our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through phishing simulation campaigns:

* We test our staff every month by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
* We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

Practice :
Examine an obvious fake email and make it more believable

Task 2 Interpret phishing simulation results: 
How to identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing
* identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing, and
* design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack.

How to design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack

Create a short presentation to help teams improve security awareness 
Now that you've analyzed the results, it's time to create a short presentation (3-5 slides) providing some awareness and training materials for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible. This will help us improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in this campaign.

Take away:
I recently participated in Mastercard's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Security Awareness team at Mastercard.
I worked on a project to identify phishing emails and design security awareness training courses. Through this job simulation, I built my skills in problem-solving, data analysis, and data presentation and practiced them in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working in cybersecurity and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Security Awareness team at a company like Mastercard.
