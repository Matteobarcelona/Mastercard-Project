# Mastercard Job Simulation

Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

Task 1:
What threat phishing presents to an organization and what different types of phishing emails look like:
* Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone/something to get information, in most cases, this is usually a password.
* Attackers may send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or lure them into providing financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.
* Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. So it’s very important that we keep the business and our staff safe from harm.

How Mastercard prevents and mitigates phishing threats:
At Mastercard, one of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by educating our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through phishing simulation campaigns:

* We test our staff every month by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
* We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

Practice :
Examine an obvious fake email and make it more believable 
current example:
From: mastercardsIT@gmail.com
To: employee@email.com 
Subject: URGENT!  Password Reset Required—

Body: 

Hello (insert name)  ,

Your email account has been compromised.  immediate action is required to reset your password!

Click here to reset your password in the next hour or your account will be locked: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)
 
Regards,Mastercard IT


Phishing email after improvements to give more credibilities:
From: mastercards IT staff 
To: employee@email.com  
Subject: Password Reset Required 
 
Body:  
 
Dear (insert name), 

 
We have to inform you that we received an alert from our system saying that your email account has been compromised.  You are required to immediately reset your password in order to avoid any security breach in our system. 
 
Click here to reset your password in the next hour or your account will be locked. 

We would like to inform you also on the importance to keep our system safe from external threats so as every employee of Mastercards you need to secure as much as possible your employee details. 

Let´s keep the world safe together!

Task 2 Interpret phishing simulation results: 
How to identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing
* identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing, and
* design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack.
